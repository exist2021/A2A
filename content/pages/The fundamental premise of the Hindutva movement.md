The Hindutva movement's fundamental issue is that if the Muslim population in India exceeds 30 per cent, things will become very unstable. The principle behind this fear is that demographic is destiny. If the minority population grows, there is a power imbalance.

To avoid this imbalance stage, which is estimated to happen when the Muslim population reaches 30 per cent of the total population of India. They believe we will be politically unstable or have a separatist movement like Kashmir if we reach this point. To avoid this kind of civil war state, we need to start a movement now known as the Hindu moment. This movement aims to stabilise the Muslim population at the current 15 per cent.

Looking at the growth rate of the Muslim population, it is clear that they are growing slightly faster than the Hindu population. With a growth rate of around 2.2, compared to the Hindu growth rate of 2, there is a fear that the Muslim population will continue to increase. They are also alleged to be adding to the population via illegal migrants. To curtail this growth, they want to take action against illegal migrants and perhaps impose monogamy.

## Background

The Hindutva movement is a consequence of the rise of the new elites. They were the new rich minted due to the liberalisation of the economy in 1991 by the Narshimha Rao and the Manmohan Singh government. The newly acquired affluence gave these emerging elites a voice in the new political discourse. Their children got even more vocal since 2010 on social media. Now social media is a perpetual war between the children of the counter-elites and the grandchildren of the anglophone elites. 

### Economics created right-wing politics. 

Business leaders supported the leaders who vocalised the ideology of these counter-elites. Tata, Adani, and Ambani proximity to Narendra Modi is a good example. The values of society give us the political class. A society is a complex system influenced by economics, religion, policy, and many others. It has thousands of years of consciousness. That is why textbooks and historical narratives are being put into new right-wing perspectives. You are correcting the fault lines in societyâ€™s consciousness. 

The thing which gets my goat is people blame the BJP and right-wing politics, but society is the real symptom if the disease is right-wing majoritarian politics and liberals cannot see it.
