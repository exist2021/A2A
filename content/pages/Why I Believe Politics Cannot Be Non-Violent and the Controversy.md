Politics, a realm of power struggles and conflicting agendas. It's a world where compromise often takes a backseat to ambition, and where the pursuit of influence can sometimes overshadow ethical considerations. In this blog post, I aim to explore why I firmly believe that politics cannot be non-violent, while also delving into the controversial perception surrounding one of history's most renowned advocates for non-violence - Mahatma Gandhi.

## The Illusion of Non-Violent Politics

Let's face it - politics and non-violence are like oil and water; they simply don't mix. The very essence of politics revolves around power dynamics, opposing sides vying for control over resources or policies. While bloodshed may be avoided in some instances, the pressure tactics employed by politicians can still be considered as acts of violence.

Political campaigns thrive on strategies aimed at influencing public opinion through manipulation and coercion. Whether it's exploiting societal divisions or utilizing fear-mongering techniques, these tactics may not leave physical scars but inflict psychological harm nonetheless. The relentless pursuit of power inherently involves violent tendencies masked behind eloquent speeches and promises.

## Unraveling the Gandhian Paradox

Now let's address the elephant in the room - Mahatma Gandhi himself. Undoubtedly an iconic figure who preached peace and advocated for non-violence throughout his life, Gandhi is hailed as one of history's greatest leaders. However, upon closer examination, we find ourselves faced with a paradox.

Gandhi spearheaded movements such as Quit India and Satyagraha which aimed to pressure authorities into achieving specific goals. Although these movements were labeled as non-violent at their core, they relied on tactics that can be perceived as forms of violence. Pressuring and attempting to achieve goals through forceful means may not involve physical harm, but it still goes against the very essence of non-violence.

## The Fallacy of Non-Violent Idealism

Non-violence, in my view, is not about pressurizing others or forcefully making them aware. It's about peacefully conveying one's perspective and attempting to bring about change through understanding and empathy. However, we must question whether this idealistic notion can ever truly manifest within the realm of politics.

Politics is a complex arena where opposing sides clash over differing ideologies and agendas. It's an environment where compromise often seems like a distant dream. While we may strive for non-violent approaches, the inherent power struggles involved make it nearly impossible to divorce politics from acts that can be considered violent.

## Rethinking Our Understanding of Violence

It's crucial for us to broaden our definition of violence beyond physical harm alone. Pressurizing someone without physically harming them can still inflict emotional distress and manipulation. By redefining our understanding of violence, we open ourselves up to acknowledging its various manifestations within political spheres.

As citizens invested in building a just society, let us critically analyze and question our perceptions surrounding non-violence in politics. Only by doing so can we hope to navigate the complexities with clarity and work towards creating meaningful change while remaining cognizant of the inherent challenges posed by power dynamics.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that politics cannot exist devoid of violence due to its inherently competitive nature and pursuit of power. While Mahatma Gandhi remains an influential figure who advocated for non-violence throughout his life, his methods raise important questions regarding the true nature of his philosophy.

Let us continue engaging in thoughtful discussions around these topics, challenging our own beliefs, and striving for a more nuanced understanding of violence within politics. Only through open dialogue can we hope to shape a future where non-violence is not just an ideal but a tangible reality.
