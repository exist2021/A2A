I finally watched this documentary by men’s rights activist (mra) [Deepika Bhardwaj](https://twitter.com/DeepikaBhardwaj); Deepika has also produced a documentary called Matryr’s of Marriage. I thought I should quickly review the documentary before I forget about it. My short-term and long-term memory has never been good.

## About the Documentary

The documentary is hosted by Karan Oberoi, who was part of a very popular boy band in the 90s. He was accused by his scorned lover (the case is still in the courts as per the end credits) in 2019 of rape. He was incarcerated for 30 days and was left out for bail.

The documentary is narratives of various men falsely accused of Rape. It includes some experts and lawyers and a lady police officer’s commentary also on the lacunae of the law. One statement by the lady officer has resonated with me greatly. Let me paraphrase it. She says that all fights for gender equality have made the law more unequal. I resonate with this statement; it is called the reverse effect. Instead of finding the root cause of rape and sexual violence again women, we have, via law, started abusing men. The documentary says that 85% of the rape cases accused turn out to be innocent. This is to the extent the law is used.

Crime Syndicates are honey-trapping rich men and then blackmailing them. One guy who got accused of Rape by his (ex)wife went as far as becoming a lawyer but eventually gave up and committed suicide, leaving a thirteen-page-long suicide note.

## Are the laws unequal?

Yes, after the Nirbhaya case, the laws are all for the woman. For instance - A man can be picked up on the same day the FIR is registered and put under incarceration. One of the guys who spent forty days in prison says that the cell conditions in the jail barracks were so unhygienic that he wanted to kill himself. For example, In a 100 sqft jail cell, there is a half-open toilet which sometimes has no water.

The police and even the judges know that the laws are so skewed in favour of the women that they dare not do or think anything contrarian. Men sometimes spend years in jail, and no compensation is given to falsely accused people. If they claim compensation, they must fight the state when they are already worn out and tired.

## My opinion

It is a hopeless situation and complete abuse of the benevolent and chivalrous law. Something which can be done immediately to alleviate the hopeless and despondent situations.

1.  No incarceration is based on FIR. The crime has already been committed. Unless the accused will tamper with the evidence or is some powerful, rich man, there is no fear in the woman’s life. What is the point in locking up based on FIR?
  
2.  Women should be protected, so laws should be skewed in favour of women, but bad actors should be smoked out. The woman who has falsely accused has to compensate the man and his family for the loss of income and bear rehabilitation costs or should go to jail.
  
3.  Media should follow restraint. Guys like Arnab Goswami do more harm than good for TRPs. Why is he claims to be a journalist when he is running a business?
