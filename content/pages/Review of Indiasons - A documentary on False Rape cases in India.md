I finally watched this documentary by men’s rights activist[Deepika Bhardwaj](https://twitter.com/DeepikaBhardwaj). I thought I should quickly review the documentary before I forget about it. My short-term and long-term memory has never been good.
> Note -  Deepika has earlier also produced a documentary called [Matryr’s of Marriage](https://youtu.be/vKRAkw5RUdw)

## About the Documentary

The documentary is hosted by [Karan Oberoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Oberoi), who was part of a popular boy’s band in the 90s. He was accused by his scorned lover (the case is still in the courts as per the end credits) in 2019 of rape. He was incarcerated for 30 days and was left out on bail.

The documentary consists of narratives of various men falsely accused of Rape. It includes comments by experts, lawyers, and a lady police officer on the lacunae of the laws on rape. One statement by the lady officer has resonated with me greatly. Let me paraphrase it. **She says that all fights for gender equality have made the law more unequal**. I resonate with this statement; it is called the reverse effect. Instead of finding the root cause of rape and reasons for the sexual violence against women, we have, via law, started abusing men.

### Eighty-five percent of false cases

The documentary cites [National Crime Records Bureau]({{twitter https://twitter.com/DeepikaBhardwaj/status/1662809616219267072?s=20}}) that 85% of the rape cases accused turn out to be innocent. This is to the extent the law is abused.

#### Counter Argument from an LLM model 

I fed this text to Claude, an LLM AI, which gave me a critique. It says the following. 

> The documentary claims that 85% of rape cases accused are innocent. However, this statistic is likely misleading given India's low rape conviction rates, which reflect issues with police investigations and judicial procedures rather than false accusations.

Crime Syndicates are honey-trapping rich men and then blackmailing them. One guy who got accused of Rape by his (ex)wife went as far as becoming a lawyer but eventually gave up and committed suicide, leaving a thirteen-page-long suicide note.

## Are the laws unequal?

Yes, after the Nirbhaya case, the laws are highly skewed in favour of women. If she says she has been raped, it is enough to file an FIR. The man can be picked up on the same day the FIR is registered and put under incarceration. 

One of the guys who spent thirty days in prison says that the cell conditions in the jail barracks were so unhygienic that he wanted to kill himself. He says that in his 100 sq-ft jail cell, there was a half-open toilet which sometimes had no water, there were about 300 inmates in a single barrack with people no place to sleep and the other guys feet was sometimes right in front of your face.

The police and even the judges know that the laws are so skewed in favour of the women that they dare not do or think anything contrarian. Men sometimes spend years in jail, and no compensation is given when the court sets them free when proven innocent. (If they want compensation, they must fight the state when they are already worn out and tired.)

## My opinion

It is a hopeless situation and complete abuse of the benevolent and chivalrous laws. The laws are well-intentioned but were knee-jerk reactions over the Nirbhaya case protests, as per the documentary.

Some things which are so obvious that can be done immediately to alleviate the hopeless and despondent situation per me are.

1.  No incarceration should be based on FIR only. (The crime has already been committed. Unless the accused will tamper with the evidence or is some powerful, rich man, there is no fear for the woman’s life. What is the point in locking up based on FIR?)
2.  Women should be protected, so I see why the laws need to be skewed in favour of women. But bad actors should be screened out. The woman who has falsely accused has to compensate the man and his family for the loss of income and bear rehabilitation costs or should go to jail.
3.  Media should follow restraint. Guys like Arnab Goswami do more harm than good for TRPs. Why is he claims to be a journalist when he is running a business?
4.  Improving police investigations and judicial procedures to increase rape conviction rates while ensuring actual innocence is established in cases of acquittals. (This point was added after being suggested by Claude, an LLM AI)
