I routinely talk about my digestion issues here. So today I thought I might discuss potty workflows. 

I mean we spend a lot of time on our work workflows so why not have a workflow for the excretion of waste.

## I grew up thinking we poop only in the morning

So my poop habits in childhood are influenced by my dad. He went to the office at 8 am and came back at 10 pm. I know, he used the loo only once in the morning.

So I naturally thought that pooping once a day was natural to humans.

### Things went bad when I couldn't stick to the one poop a day unsaid rule!

No one really told me that I am only supposed to poop in the morning. But I generally maintained this habit till I had an office to go to. But then as soon as I shifted to work from home in 2001. (Yes, I have been WFH since 2001, suckers!!!) things started going south. 

I started having more than one poop a day and it was sometimes a couple in the morning and then maybe before bedtime.

## Internet Research on Poop Habits

Confused about why I am pooping at odd hours. I did some research on the internet. 

I read westerners sometimes didn't poop for two or three days. Chi... ganda.



## The Research led nowhere! 

So again I discovered some westerners pooped two or three times also. I figured copying the westerners would be a safer bet.

This led me to openly talk about my poop issues on Instagram. A gay acquaintance recommended that for every meal we intake, we need to expel a poop. His logic is flawed, if we expel everything we ingest where do we get the energy from. Some matter has to be converted to energy no, like blood, semen and sweat???

But I thought he is gay and who would know better about anal hygiene than a gay guy. 

The idea stuck!



### Down the Slippery Slope! 

> If you however decide to follow the "One poop per meal" workflow like be me, this is a post to warn you. 

The rule which I didn't get is that the more you poop the more you feel like pooping. You soon end up on a slippery road down the toilet.



#### Fortify your intake with pro and pre-biotics

In case you are having poop issues. I recommend you include a lot of pro-biotics or you will feel bloated and always want to poop.





## You want to know what are probiotics and prebiotcs?

I don't cook, so I stick to fruits. Almost all fruits are pro-biotic, but something which is very soothing to the stomach is papaya, pineapple and bananas. 

Other stuff like kefir, curd, and fermented vegetables like sauerkraut and kimchi are very good. 

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any poop advice in the comments below.
