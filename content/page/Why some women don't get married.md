## So what kind of woman does not get married?

1. The one who has no other siblings competing for their parents' resources.
2. Unable to find a higher status man (because she is more educated or earns much more than potential partners available to her).

What are your thoughts on this? I analyse women because I am a man. That might make it seem like I am suggesting that women are only after status. But evolutionary psychologists defend a women's mating strategies with the following statement. 

> Women will always try to find the optimal mate so they can feel secure while raising children.
