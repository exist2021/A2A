title:: Will you marry me Aalika Mahindra?

I was bedridden since Saturday evening with high fever. Today it would be safe to say I am out on a limb. Also, I am turning 50 this month. Do people do crazy delirious stuff on turning 50, isn’t it like “abhi, kabhi bhi bulava aa sakta hai”? So let’s go all out on a limb.

Some points to remember before you proceed. 
1. This is a brain dump.
2. Italics mean what I speak inside my mind.
3. It is a very long read. Precisely 5738 words. Save it to read later if you are busy now. 
4. The content is more about me that about Aalika Mahindra 
5. I don’t have google analytics on this blog, so be rest assured this not a click bait headline. 

It is kind of a marriage proposal but I don’t think Aalika is impressed by such PDA’s {Public display of affection)”. So why am I doing it? Writing is my tool for empowerment. I had a need to get this story out of my stomach, but it is too nuanced for people to hear it out. Yes, there are chances I might piggy back on famous brand name. I don't really mind that/ 

We live in very short-lived attention spans. Friends only call you when they have a CLT(Call to Action) and relationships are also mostly maintained so as one can die without any guilt. Then your only recourse to protection is your intimate better half if you are lucky to have a spouse devoted to you. The one way to get around this tragedy of loss on connections is to write and people can read at their convenience. It is indeed sad, that in a society so much depends on having a family for survival. Friendship was supposed to fill this gap. But i guess after an age friendships are impossible to form. I no longer relate to my college friends. They won’t get the nuance or they are scared of talking to man who is on the verge of bankruptcy. 

So let’s begin. I remember there was this joke in the family, I am not sure who planted this in my head. I think it was my mischievous aunt Ammi Vahini who was living with us at that point of time. At the age of five, when I was asked how will I make a living when I grow up. I would ask my Dad who was the richest men in India. He had said, Tata, Birla and Mafatlal. The I would go and tell people I would marry the daughters of one of these rich men and would never have to earn for myself. Born Gold-digger!

Well, that was not to be the case. I married a nice girl from a good family. Relatively rich, but not stinking rich. So I forgot about this entire childhood joke. Unfortunately I was too immature back then to understand the complexities of marriage and in seven years we were divorced. I lost my two precious kids in the bargain and wept for a couple of years about it. 

I i knew how tough life of a single man could be I would have tried my best to save the marriage. But I had lost my father withthin six months of the marriage. I had no connection to my birth mother. This is why having elders are needed in every family. They have wisdom of hindsight which the young can use to save themselves from lot of trauma and hardships. After having learnt this lesson I have started to respect the elders. I pray the young take time to pause and dig into this resource.

Now toughness has different takes. I feel most of the people who know me think I have had an easy life. There could be reasons for the same. I joined my dad’s business of manufacturing electrical switchgear and moulded products. In two years time when I married, I was managing the entire operations of the Jalgoan factory, while he was running the Ratnagiri factory. So at the age when people have to struggle, I became a boss to about 150 workers. The clients were also surprised that I had managed to scale up so well, I was making 50% of their total monthly production targets at probably 1/10th of the cost. But I was rather uncomfortable about the dependency on one single client for all the revnues. Anyway, there was nothing I could do about it. In India it is easy to start a factory than close a damn one. You need to seek the permission from the Maharashtra government if you have more than 100 workers. Labour contractors are a way of bypassing such a draconian measure, which many take advantage off. 

All, was well, until my dad’s passed away in a bus on his way to Ratnagiri. He has just boarded the bus, which had to run to catch. That fateful day he was carrying two heavy moulds. At the age of sixty he had put to much strain on his heart. This shows the lack of intimacy in his life. He had married again at the age of fifty to a nice woman who i think was much above his class in terms of culture. It was more of need of the other than the meeting of hearts and mind. If he had love in his life, no one would have ever let a sixty year old man carry two heavy steel moulds. 

I got a call 3:30 am in the morning and me and my wife decided to drive down to Mumbai from Jalgaon. I was scared as hell, I had never seen a balance sheet in my life back then. I only knew how to hire and fire and inspire people on the shop floor. This required a complete change in my personality. I think from the time of my father death, my marriage started to give away. I had become a different man. 

The factory business ended in 2008. I had about 14L of silver contacts which is used in electric swithgear missing. This was the first time such a thing had happened. I had no hedge against countering such a situation. I mean there are so many workers anyone could have done it. Only way to avoid this was to sell off the factory premises. I got a buyer in no time and move on. 

I thought I has about three years of runaway before I lose all my savings and go completely broke. I had many loans and I cleared them all. Loans were so easy to get back then, My Hiranandani gardens address and income statement was enought to get a loan approved in a couple of days maximum. So I had been taking a lot of loans. So I feel I had spent fourteen years of my life in my manufacturing business earning for the banks. 

With almost no capital left and never having created a business from a scratch I had no idea what I was supposed to do professionally. My life had always been just doing what comes to me and I lacked any instincts for long term planning. I was running a community for Salsa dancers back then. It have given me lucky break with women. I got a couple of hookups with some very beautiful woman. I thought how about starting a community which makes money? 

So I started a hyperlocal media business. On the first day of my marketing walk in the neighbourhood, I signed up close to Rs 50000/- in ad slots. Phew, man I never knew business owners were so hungry for another media. In a couple of years the ad revenue has stabilised to 5L per year. I wanted to grow!

This is the time I saw a tweet from Anand Mahindra, introducing his daughters “Bandra Project”. Hey, I thought it looks something similar, should I bother contacting her? Do such “bade log” ever reply? Anyway I send her an email introducing my project for Powai and I thought it was similar to her Bandra one. I said in my mind “ Hit send and forget”. Maybe a day or two I got a reply. She said her project is different, but she will pass the word around. When writing the email to her I had visualised Anand Mahindra’s daughter a married woman. So there was no attempt to pursue her. That was the end of the story. 

I used to live Powai, Hiranandani Garden’s. I felt the place was so dull, there was no culture there. But then I came across a tweet about a cultural event at Vikhroli. Once again twitter working it’s magic in my life. I sent an email to the host and the host sent an immediate warm reply that I was welcome. I started attending this bi-monthly events (or monthly event regularly?) I loved the events, i had never seen so many intelligent audience under one roof. I didn’t even know the meaning of some of the words the audience used in the questions to the speaker (like pedagogy, ontology). 

One of the event, the speaker was lady from the fashion industry. I was kinda bored was I was looking forward to the free snacks at the end of the show. As I didn’t want to go home and eat the food my bai had made. There were say a hundred people in that after event venue. There I saw standing a young girl right in front of my line of sight. I couldn’t take my eyes of her. I thought she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. But then I realised there are hundred other people it doesn’t look good to just stare at someone. Besides she looked 19 at the most 21. Means she is about 20 years old younger than you. Also, from her clothing she looks from an extremely wealthy family. I said I had no chance. Also, I could tell the host was kinda chuddi-buddy with her. So what if he doesn’t like my staring and ban me from the event for lusting for a woman half my age. Why risk free chat and pani-poori and bet on a woman who will will say to me “Not my type”. However I kept glimpsing at her now sideways and no longer in her line of sight. I still wanted to go and talk to her, but that day some of my other media colleagues were attending the show and they wouldn’t give me a spare moment. 

I came home but I couldn’t take my mind off her. I had to find out who she was!!! My only tool at my disposal again was twitter. I knew she was close to the host, so they will be exchanging some tweets about the event. There is was. Now I knew it was Aalika, but I need to double check. I googled. There were fortunately a couple of pics of her. It was a match. 

I had got lucky. I don’t remember but I send her an email and didn’t get any reply. I thought why bother. Then there was another event with that India famous mythologist at Vikroli. They had changed the venue to seat 1000 attendees. I thought this fucker (the speaker) must be really popular. There I am seated in this big venue and then after sometime I see Aalika come and sit right next to me. Now I am encouraged, there are thousand seats here, she could have sat anywhere. I am emboldened.I ask her are you the Bandra Project lady and I am the guy who emailed you and then eventually I end up asking for her number, she gives it to me. 

At the same time, I got a notice from a bank for loan which my dad was a guarantor in 1988 and I had to pay 70 lacs within a week otherwise my Hiranandani Gardens house would be auctioned off to recover their dues. I think I had a seven day , till i sold the house on the seventh day. A friend had come bought the house. 

I had never ever lived on rent ever. But I thought I will manage, the money left over after paying the everyone wouldn’t get me a house in any mumbai suburb. I was not ready to move out of Mumbai to panvel types after enjoying the Hiranandani Gardens lifestyle for more than a decade. 

I loved a nice one BHK in Powai. I finalised the deal with the broker, but the broker come back the next day saying the society has a rule that no “single men” allowed to rent. But I thought my single female friend was living there until she moved out last year. But the keyword is “single men”. Now talk about gender injustice when it happens to men. I saw more house in Powai, but they were all 2BHK’s and way over my budget. Then an idea hit me, Aalika is doing her bandra project, If i shift to Bandra, I will get to hangout with her? 

Immediately after moving to Bandra, I sent a email to Aalika asking to meet over coffee. I sent three email to her for the same and she hadn’t responded. I thought, one last try and then I am done. I sent the fourth email and she responded. The date and time and coffee shop was decided. 

Bandra is a complete mess in terms of rental properties. In my budget, the broker initially showed me all “watch man’s” cabin sized pigeon holes. I increased my budget a bit, but it made me uncomfortable. I got a house in Khar. One day during the rainy season, i might have been out. I came home to see the entire false celling had collapsed. The owner acted like it was nothing new. The neighbour said the same thing happened in the middle of the night when another lady was sleeping inside and she had come out of the house screaming. I felt humiliated. The owner asked me to manage myself elsewhere for a week till he gets it fixed. 

I wanted to buy a vespa, but for the registration I had to give a address. The owner refused to give his address. The Vespa owner said don’t bother about the transfer just use it. I got the Vespa and left the house for a new house in Bandra. This time the owners were rather hospitable. It is a SRA building with blue collar workers. But at-least the building is super clean. 

One day again I came home and I saw the entire ceiling collapsed in my neighbours house. I was so scared. A plaster of paris ceiling collapse won’t kill you but a slab plaster collapse is certain death. My owner’s son arrives to see the collapse, the flat was unoccupied. I ask the owners son in panic, what if the same happens to this house “He says, “hua toh hua, yeh five star thodi hai”. I feel he just knocked some practical sense in to my head. Not to expect five start treatment when you are on a budget. 

Coming back to our coffee meet. I was nervous. I thought here I am a provincial guy. What will I talk to her. I thought just let me land there and see what happens. She had arrived before me. I got my coffee and sat down. I looked straight in to her eyes enquiring “Are we in or not” . From her eyes, I realised she was not interesting in such a conversation. So, she took charge and I was relieved. I really didn’t know what to talk. Our talk was mostly about Mumbai, Bandra, Powai. She asked me about my sister I think. I found her voice soothing and calming like a background mediation music playing. I wanted her to keep talking and had forgotten about the real goal was to hook up. Then she looked at her watch, some 20 minutes later and said she has to leave. That was awkward, I didn’t know how bid goodbye! 

That evening I felt for some reason she had taken a fancy to this loser, I was already in love with her after this meeting. I text her the next morning saying I want to talk to her. I had written a love letter confessing my love. I thought I would be nervous doing it without a written script. I think it is the most stupid idea. She texted back “let me call you in fifteen minutes.” She calls back, I confess my love. She asks me to articulate, I think what a stupid reply to my I love you”. I think I read her the letter stammering till the end. She says “But I am in a relationship”(the why the fuck did you even meet me). There is more bad news for me! She says “I leaving for US in two days.” I ask her why? She says “Her best friend is there and she wants to be with him.” (Why i can’t you tell me you want to be with your boyfriend and stop calling him your best friend?). Why is she leaving me high and dry? Baap ka paisa hai udao! Anyway, that was not how I wanted my proposal to end. I email her once she in US and replies, that phone calls would be difficult because of time zone issue but I can email her if I wanted to. This is start of my nine year long emailing trolling journey. I might be a biggest email troller in history after kangana. 

Since shifting to Bandra I had become a Flaneur, i was on the streets all the time. One day I saw Aalika in front on a slum which was supposed to go for redevelopment. I thought why does she has to do this herself, She could get it done by sending a camera man. I decide not to intrude, as I feel she too much of a professional and wouldn’t mix business with pleasure. 

Since I was into hyperlocal media and was making 5L per year with the powai business with no outgoing expenses. I decided I would justify my Bandra extravagance by earning another 5L here. Just replicate it. This time around 2013 Instagram was getting very popular. I didn’t realise until too late that all ad money has moved to Instagram. Bandra Business never took off, and Powai business went from 5L to 50k a year. Talk about how fast market changes when you are competing in a digital world. I knew I am going broke, so I had to sell whatever assets I had. 

I was writing to Aalika quite intensely. I think I told her everything about my life. However I never asked for any financial help. I thought it wouldn’t look good to do that to a girl you are pursuing. She never replied back. But I was addicted to writing to her. I had set a google alert for her name, I told her I will stop writing the day I get a google alert about your wedding. The day arrived soon. One fine day I woke to a google “Aalika Mahindra gets married”. My heart just imploded. I courageously click the link, hell no, this is Divya Mahindra (he younger sister) who got married. Someone had played some mischief by replacing Aalika’s name in the meta info. Relieved, my email writing addiction was not stopping for the time-being. 

It was NYE, I found out that Aalika was in India. I asked to come over to my place. I said, I will get the wine, you get the food. (so romantic na). Maybe she got scared of the cooking bit. So I waited all night then I went to the streets at around 4 am and came back and slept. I really didn’t know what to do this woman. I just couldn’t chuck her out of my life. 

I was at cafe one day, I was having diarrhea. The financial situation has made me nervous wreck, I had lost all confidence in talking to other people. I was in the cafe talking sly tweets about her, I knew she was sometimes reading my tweets. She suddenly appears in the cafe, My stomach gives away, I leave her alone. I spend the next couple of hours near the loo. I wonder why does love give me diarrhea? I thought she had come to talk and I had not let her. 

Again, this time, my stomach was fine. As I entered the cafe, i saw her having conversation with a guy. It looked business but I knew it was covert marriage prospecting. I thought, bitch is doing shaadi.com dates when in India. and not calling on me to check. She just froze when she saw me, she doesn’t like unexpected surprises. I saw the guy was rather smart and dapper and thought ‘If two people find love, why should I interfere and create issues?. The i saw them leaving, her driver had got the car and as she was about to enter the car, i saw her blush as she knew I was watching. I was relieved, so I still had some hopes.

But help soon arrived. I got a call that someone would like to meet me for a business offer. We decided on the venue. I reached before him. The guy looked like an ex-army man of Parsi lineage as per me. We shook hands. I felt his strength. Just from the handshake, I knew he was really physically powerful. Strangely he began asking personal questions, about my divorce etc. I thought, fuck let me give him dirty laundry if that's what it takes to get some business. I told him all. But I didn’t realise back then that telling him my personal story had put off all my defences and now I was in a very vulnerable position. He said he had to leave now as he had to report to someone. *Huh, where is my business talk?* We started walking towards the exit. He stopped midday, he said one more thing. “He said her father wants you to stop writing to Aalika” I am paraphrasing, but the message was to stop writing. I was stunned! He has disappeared before I could come back to my senses. I reached home and was seething in rage. Rage makes me feverish, I had a high temperature and was shivering. I was also starving. I ate an entire watermelon at 9 pm and then crapped. The fever was gone. I was angry as to why a grown-up woman cannot pick up her phone and convey the message and wants to get her super dad into the picture. 

I stopped writing. I thought maybe I had abused her. I am a father too and I would have perhaps done the same thing if I saw a guy bothering my daughter. Maybe I stopped for six months, but then some signs appeared. I decided to try my luck again. I however choose to keep it friendly and not be romantic or act like a scorned lover. I also decided I would write once a month only. Some of the emails said, “hey, A quick Hi, hope all is well with you”. Sometimes it was a bit longer if I thought I was something worth sharing. 

My professional life had totally collapsed. At one point in my life, I had only 2000 Rs in my bank. I decided I should go out to meet clients, otherwise, I will be dead soon otherwise. I managed to book an appointment with a lady who runs a boutique. I went there and met her. I was such a nervous wreck that I started shaking and stammering. I knew this Rs 3000 Rs, If I got from her, would make me live a week more. She was smart, she gave me a cheque for Rs 3000/-. I was relieved. I called her the next day, she was cold, she said the same night she had a burglary at her store. From her tone, I felt she suspected I was behind. I felt so humiliated. I never went out for another sales call ever again. 

Then I remember I had met a Bollywood producer at a book launch a year back at a book launch and he had offered me his card and asked to meet. I never thought of his offer, since I thought what do I know about Bollywood? But I needed work desperately. I called him and he agreed to meet the same evening. I landed at his house and immediately I was offered a shandy. I thought this is a friendly start. From his house, I realised this guy was quite wealthy so maybe he can help me. I asked for work. He said, he wants a Wikipedia page for himself. I said I can do it. I was so desperate that I did the Wikipedia page the very next day. He called me over for dinner. We have a wholesome meal over wine. This was the first time I felt I was given dinner in Bandra. I got up to leave. I was so happy with his treatment, that I hugged him, and then to my horror, he tried to kiss me! I dodged it and I pretended not to notice. I immediately left his house. He followed up by saying he has tickets to this play and another big Bollywood biggie is joining, will I join? I said sure, why not? I thought he should know by now, that I am not into gay stuff. I was wrong. We went to a club for a drink after the show. He was touching my things in the car which I could feel was not how one man touches another man. I was totally repulsed. I never got any payment for the Wikipedia page and anyway it is unethical to charge for Wikipedia (maybe the dinner at his house was the compensation for the Wikipedia page) but I had expectations of some other work. 

Now, I thought I would be dead soon. Some friends sensed my distress and helped me with part-time jobs. One such friend/Boss accused me of lying to him to which I replied if he was in front of me I would have punched him. He then said since I had disrespected him we could no longer work together. But I was prepared. It pushed me to the unthinkable, I borrowed from my children's future, and prematurely withdrew the Life Insurance Policy. The policy plan was so good that the insurance lady asked me more than a couple of times if I was sure cause that plan doesn't exist anymore. I was guilt ridden. I got a breather for six months. But even that money was gone. I sold off whatever I had, skateboards, DSLR etc. But every now and then my bank balance came to Rs 2000.

Then the washing machine broke, and my body was broken way long back. All this precarious living had whacked my digestive system out of its place. I was bloated or had mild diarrhoea. I had lost weight and was looking gaunt. The kind of look rich people want to achieve. My stomach was totally flat and hollow. I couldn’t digest anything. Now along with work, I had the double job of how to manage my frail body. I had been living on Zomato and the ordered as per my budget. I tried cooking at home, but it become so much of a mess. How women achieve this is a mystery to me, no wonder women are said to be more organised. 

As I lay there sick on my couch looking at heaps of unwashed clothes and the broken washing machine. Which I had no means to repair from my last 2000 Rs. 

The same week I got a call from a guy who said some friend of mine had referred him and he had a project for me. I check his credentials he was from MIT, and Aalika’s buddy was from MIT. But I thought it could be just one of those many coincidences. I got a job. 

This job changed my entire life for the better. Slowly my health improved. I started learning about nutrition. Decide to order/eat only from places which agree with my stomach and my wallet. No wonder salaried people look so centred. A fixed monthly income reduced your anxiety by almost 50%. 

My Boss said, please plan the trip to Abu Dhabi. He had sent some advance payments. But again after paying my bills I was back to Rs 2000. I converted the Rs 2000 into UAE dinar and took the flight. On landing, I saw a counter which marked the price from Airport to City. It came to about 2700 Rs. I didn’t have that much. I decided maybe there would be a bus at this time of the night or I could just walk it. I was told it was a 1.5-hour drive to the city. But as I came out of the gate I saw sweet looking gentleman holding a placard with my name. I was so relieved. The trip went well and on the evening I was supposed to leave I saw my boss tearing up. I thought what a sweet guy. Maybe I am working for the right person this time around and I am still working for him. 

The one-way email love affair has to end. I felt If I cannot forget her, I should replace her”. But I was just not seeing any woman around. Then one day I was at the art gallery. There was this dark complexion lady with curls. I thought she was beautiful and I would love to make love to her. I did a fifteen-second risk analysis. I thought if the woman is at an art gallery she has to be open-minded. That was enough for me. I went up to her and I said, “I love your complexion, and can I have your number?” She looked so dumbstruck and flattered at the same time, she asked me “Who are you?” I muttered I am running a media publication. I asked her about what she does ‘ She said she teaches at an Art school”. She then gave her number. I smiled and said that was a quick win. But then I messaged her the next day, there was no reply. After a month I spotted her at the art gallery, she was with a guy, and as I moved closer, she gripped her guy strongly. WTF, am I going to eat you that you have to hold on to him so tight? Still no lady luck. 

I kept writing every month, I thought by now that Aalika would be married with a few kids in tow and all my emails must be going into the spam folder. Still, I didn’t have the courage to quit. I felt there was still a faint connection. Very faint, but still I need to wait.

It was now 2021 September, I decided to end this one-way email trolling. I wrote the final one and said, thanking her for being there and finally I have the strength to stop writing. In December I get a strange DM asking me to recommend a vet. It is a fake account, I am irritated why is this 17-year-old bothering me. I pass her on to a vet I know. This fake account then again starts a conversation. Now I am getting some hints. In no time I know it is her! We hit off well. But I don’t remember what happened, she managed to offend me and I block her. Phew, but then I think I pursued this woman for nine years, hoping one day she will talk to me and when started talking I get offended within a week. I feel that is unfair to her and what would I do without her anyway? I unblock and she sportingly joins back in. 

But getting offended is another of my addiction. She makes remarks on my work habits as I keep roaming around instead of working. I tell her why don’t you come live with me and do my dishes and cook for me, then I will stop roaming around. Basically, I thought it was time to explain the skin in the game concept. But then I reflected back I thought she has a point. I stopped roaming around galleries and hanging out at cafes. And my work output was 5x. I was delivering on time.

While she is excellent at listening, she doesn't give any information. I thought I had a right to know about her past affairs. on which her answer was "if you talk about your past wounds it becomes a tamasha". Well, that stopped me on my tracks.

I still knew I had no chance of marriage to her. She must be fucking out of her freaking mind if she married such a loser. She said “every survivor is a winner”. Well, I can bet how I managed to survive I only know. Maybe you know now.  That helped, it made me feel better. There is at least one person who doesn’t think of me as a loser.

But there were conflicts. In one such situation, she said something very offensive. I was so angry, that I couldn’t sleep all night and was wondering how to get back at her. I think, I woke up and messaged her that she was a spoilt brat and she deserves a slap. The same night I was now dreaming about how to execute this slap plan. But she stopped talking, I got scared, and I withdrew my slap offer. But still no news. She hasn’t talked to me since I think March 2022. 

I still keep sending messages to her fake account and god knows how long this will continue unless she accepts my marriage proposal to get off the troll list. 

If you read this entire piece. You have some patience and compassion! I haven’t yet figured out how to add comments to this blog since I never get any. But feedbacks are welcome if you smart enough to find my email. (no WhatsApp please)!
